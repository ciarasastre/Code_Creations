Click the center button to begin.
Once you are in the space station navigate your way through space using the LEFT and RIGHT 
arrow keys!

To zoom in and out of each planet use the UP and DOWN arrow keys. If you want the travelling speed to go faster
click the SPEED BUTTON. The max speed is 3 after that you will go back to 1.

Make sure that your OXYGEN is topped up by clicking the oxygen button. If it hits 0 you will start to feel
faint and your vision will blurr.

You need to make sure that the FUEL is also topped up on your ship otherwise the ship will completly stop
and you will be unable to move.

If you want to keep an eye on the position on the planets the RADAR will point you in the direction North, South, East, West
that you are facing. There is also a TABLE below display the x and y coordinates of the planets.

Enjoy and have fun exploring!
